# Stock Ticker Search Bar

This is a simple search bar that allows you to search for stock tickers and their exchange. It is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://vercel-nextjs-postgres.vercel.app/](https://vercel-nextjs-postgres.vercel.app/).

## Usage

To use the search bar, simply type in the name or symbol of the stock you are looking for and press enter. The search bar will display the stock ticker and its exchange.

Furthermore, it will reroute you to another site which calculates the support and resistance level for the corresponding symbol.

## Technologies Used

This search bar was built using react and typescript with Postgres as database and a python api hosted on google clouds.
